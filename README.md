**Setting**

In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and yōkai.

Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the Domain, all of their attacks are guaranteed to hit and will grow in strength.

**Plot**

Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally physically strong high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed in June 2018, his grandfather instils two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people". Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. However upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of Cursed Spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of Jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior.

Gojo partners Yuji and Megumi with fellow first-year Tokyo student Nobara Kugisaki, training them to become sorcerers, but during a mission gone wrong, Sukuna gains full control of Yuji's body, so Yuji allows the both of them to die. Despite this, Sukuna brings Yuji back to life, having grown an interest in Megumi. Aware the Jujutsu high-ups intend to kill Yuji, Gojo keeps his resurrection a secret to continue training him. On a mission with experienced Jujutsu Sorcerer Kento Nanami, Yuji meets fellow student Junpei Yoshino, who falls victim to Mahito's manipulations, leading Yuji to swear vengeance.

Gojo reveals Yuji being alive during the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools. The Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately so schemes to get it done, while the Tokyo students help Yuji. During the event, Cursed Spirits attack the schools, but are fought off by Yuji, Gojo, and third-year Kyoto student Aoi Todo, though Mahito steals three "Death Paintings" (half-human half-Curses), and summons them.

After Yuji is able to consume several of Sukuna's fingers and kill two of the Death Paintings with Nobara's help, disfigured second-year Kyoto student Kokichi Muta, who controls the Cursed Corpse Mechamaru, is revealed to be a mole working with Geto and Mahito. Muta betrays them to protect his friends, only to be killed by Mahito. On Halloween, the Cursed Spirits unleash their ultimate plan by releasing several barriers over Shibuya. Gojo exorcises various Cursed Spirits, but is sealed away by Geto in a special artifact, the Prison Realm. The events also reveal that the current Geto is not the original but rather Geto's corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku.

Yuji and his allies face Kenjaku's forces in order to rescue Gojo. Yuji faces Choso, the third Death Painting sibling, and is defeated, only to be spared due to Choso receiving a vision revealing they are brothers. The Cursed Spirit Jogo force-feeds Yuji ten fingers, re-awakening Sukuna, who kills Jogo and destroys a massive portion of the city. Mahito kills Nanami and mortally wounds Nobara, but with the help of Todo, Yuji is able to defeat him. Kenjaku absorbs Mahito, and using his Cursed Technique, re-awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan that Kenjaku had been planting for thousands of years, as well as unleashing a slew of Curses to usher in chaos and a world of Cursed Spirits reminiscent of the Heian period, the prime period of Jujutsu Sorcerers.

In the aftermath, the Jujutsu higher-ups sentence Yuji to death, with second-year student Yuta Okkotsu appointed as his executioner, but Yuta helps Yuji fake his death. Yuji and Megumi team up with Yuta and experienced sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo, both being special grade Jujutsu Sorcerers, along with Choso and second-year student Maki Zen'in to meet Master Tengen, an immortal, part-Curse part-human Jujutsu Sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with Japan's human population using "the Culling Games", a battle royale between all the awakened sorcerers to accumulate a massive amount of cursed energy allowing him to achieve this goal.

Maki goes to the Zen'in compound to collect Cursed Tools to assist in the fight, but is forced to kill her entire clan when they lay a trap for her. Meanwhile, Yuji, Yuta, Megumi, second-year student Panda, and third-year student Kinji Hakari, seek out a mysterious woman named "Angel" who can free Gojo from the Prison Realm, as well as find a way to rescue Megumi's step-sister, Tsumiki, from participating in the Games.

The group discovers Angel and the Culling Games serve its purpose in acquiring a surplus of cursed energy for Kenjaku's plans; he succeeds in killing Yuki and capturing Tengen. They then learn that Tsumiki has become a host for a reincarnated sorcerer, and Sukuna uses this opportunity to execute his ultimate plan: taking control of Megumi's body. He succeeds, kills Tsumiki, and regroups with Kenjaku. The main group are able to use Angel's power to free Gojo from the Prison Realm. Gojo, now unsealed, agrees with Sukuna and Kenjaku to fight on December 24th.

Gojo faces off against Sukuna and Megumi's Ten Shadows, managing to beat them, however, Sukuna survives and slices Gojo in half, killing him. The rest of the sorcerers, including Yuji (who, with Choso's approval, consumed the remaining Death Paintings), soon join in the battle, with Sukuna reviving himself to his true form in the process. Meanwhile, as Kenjaku is tracking down the remaining Culling Game players, he is confronted by Fumihiko Takaba, an unexpectedly powerful sorcerer that proves as an effective distraction, allowing Yuta to catch him off guard and decapitate him. Yuta then goes to assist Yuji, who is struggling against Sukuna.
